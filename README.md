# 🏺ChatCAS: Multimodal Ceramic Multi-Agent Studio (Consultation • Analysis • Generation)

**🔬 Agent Construction Framework for the Ceramics Domain: Application Demonstrations in Ceramic Knowledge Question-Answering and Image Analysis & Generation**  
**📅 Estimated completion time of open source project: end of 2025**

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to develop the first large language model (LLM) system specifically for the ceramic field. This system integrates rich multimodal knowledge of ceramics, multimodal evaluation datasets, and a collaborative multi-agent framework, all of which are designed to enhance expert consultation, image analysis, and creative decision-making throughout the entire ceramic design and production process.

We propose the following key modules:：
- 📊 **EvalCera**：The first multimodal evaluation dataset in the ceramics domain
- 🏺 **CeramicGPT**：The first large language model tailored for the ceramics field, capable of intelligently handling knowledge-based Q&A in the ceramics field.
- 🤖 **ChatCAS**：Driven by CeramicGPT and GPT-4o. It categorizes tasks related to the various stages of a ceramic studio, completing collaborative work through role-playing and task goal consensus. ChatCAS can effectively handle comprehensive tasks in the ceramics field, including Q&A, image analysis, and generation.
The project is dedicated to promoting the deep integration of artificial intelligence and ceramics, and supporting more scientific research and industrial application explorations.

The project is committed to promoting the deep integration of artificial intelligence and TCM acupuncture, and supporting more scientific research and clinical application exploration.

## 📌 Open Source Roadmap

We will open source gradually in the following stages：

| phase |  content | Time node (expected) |
|------|------|----------------|
| ✅ step 1 | Part of ceramic knowledge dataset | Q2 2025 |
| 🚧 step 2 | EvalCera evaluation base set | Q3 2025 |
| ⏳ step 3 | ChatCAS framework code and examples | Q4 2025 |

👉 The complete warehouse content will be unified and open source after all research work is completed and sorted out, which is expected to be by the end of 2025.
